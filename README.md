# RED Academy Web Development Sampler demo project

## How to use this repo

This demo is meant to be a code-along exercise for students in the Web Development Sampler meetup at Red Academy, Toronto.

The idea of this repo is to give instructors a path to get from the skeleton web page in the [master](https://github.com/tinacious/red-sampler-demo/tree/master) branch
to the completed page in the [completed](https://github.com/tinacious/red-sampler-demo/tree/completed) branch.

## Talking points in the code
Feel free to go off this guide, but if you're stuck, you can use these talking points:

_NOTE: it's probably a good idea to get students to reload their browser after each change so that they can see stuff changing as they code._

### What are we going to do?

* get class to download and unzip (or clone from github) the repo
* talk about what we're going to build => a page for/about your mom, dad, daughter, dog, etc...
* load the `index.html` file in the browser (you'll see nothing!)

### Let's get something on the page!
* _quickly_ explain heading tags `<h1>, <h2>, etc...` and add `<h1>` with subject's name
* skip to the `text-section` and add a subheading for "biography" and "attributes"
* _quickly_ explain paragraphs and add 1 or 2 `<p>` tags under "biography"
* _quickly_ explain lists and add a `<ul>` under "attributes"

### Okay! That's cool, but what do they look like?
* _quickly_ explain images (maybe video/audio as well?) and add a `<img>` tag for the subject

### Add some personality
* _quickly_ explain other tags that are possible, specifically `<blockquote>` and add the `quote-section` with `<blockquote>` and `<p>` tags

### Start styling!
* explain what CSS is and why it's important
* demonstrate some attributes that can be modified (color, font-size, position, etc.)
* have class modify colors, sizes, font-family, etc.
* _quickly_ explain importing Google fonts and [import a font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?selection.family=Roboto&query=slab) to use on the page

## Add responsiveness!
At this point we should have a good idea of what we can do with a web page and some simple CSS.

### What is Responsive Web Design?
* _quickly_ explain the why and what of responsive web design
* add the `layout.css` and `theme.css` files provided in the repo **ABOVE THE CUSTOM CSS WE HAVE BUILT**

## Congratulations!
At this point we should have a fully-responsive and somewhat beautiful web page that everyone can take home and show their mom.
